## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

#### How have you been? Hope you are safe and healthy!ðŸ™Œ

##### A little about myself :bowtie:

I love to work with **machines** and watch them *learn* new patterns in a **supervised/unsupervised** manner. 
I am an IT undergraduate from [GGSIP University](http://ipu.ac.in/) and is looking for new opportunities to work in the field of **Arificial Intelligence**. If you want to connect with me, the details are given below. Cheers! :tada:

I love to create a change and stand for the right thing. I wish to bring peace and harmony in this world with my skills and help man answers some peculiar questions.  :pray:

I just want to give back to the community so, alongwith learning new skills, I have been working with India's 1st Kaggle Days Meetup, [KDM Delhi NCR](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kdmdelhi) (@kdmdelhincr) diligently as an organizer taking key decisions with my fellow organizers in providing a wholesome community of learning and doubt clearing in the field of *Data Science* and *Machine Learning* with *Kaggle*. :heart:
